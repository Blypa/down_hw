# Borys Lypa Homework

## Main solution is in in the [Huggingface pretrained model file](./HuggingFace%20pretrained%20model.ipynb)

Yet it took quite a lot of time to fine-tune a pre-trained model, so I have also completed a sort of EDA in [Data Preview](./Data%20Preview.ipynb) and an example of a simple data preprocessing for a task like this [Manual preprocessing](./Manual%20preprocessing.ipynb)

You can find a saved model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F81ZCkIKW43UZQdKmVwdFwdZFwAk8_g2/view?usp=share_link)
